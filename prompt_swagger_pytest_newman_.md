# Terms of Capturing Failure Scenarios

## Methods/Approach

### 1. Flasgger Integration & Swagger UI Documentation

- Integrate Flasgger into Flask code to provide interactive Swagger UI documentation.
- For each route, add a complete YAML docstring documenting:
  - Purpose
  - Parameters (path, body)
  - All possible success and error responses

### 2. Pytest Test Suite

- Create a full Pytest test suite for Flask + PostgreSQL API.
- Ensure coverage of all REST endpoints and edge cases.

### 3. Postman/Newman Scripts & Unified Test Reporting

- Create Postman/Newman scripts to exercise maximum scenarios at the REST interface level.
- Achieve best possible coverage as per the test plan/test_cases.xlsx.
- Use a unified test-reporting framework to merge Newman automated results.

## Prompt 1: Swagger document.pdf

```
(Controller code -> app.py) 
Integrate Flasgger into the following(Below code is given for apply) Flask code to add Swagger UI documentation.
For each route, add a complete YAML docstring that accurately documents its purpose, parameters (path and body), and all possible success and error responses.

```

## Prompt 2 : Postman/Newman collection creation

```

[In this prompt there are two attachment](Swagger document.pdf)(Flask_CRUD_TestPlan_44TCs): swagger document.pdf provides rest apis with json structure Please give me postman/Newman scripts to exercise maximum scenarios That are possible at the rest interface level giving best possible coverage as per test plan test cases.xlsx.

Please provide all file in downloadable form
Example:
Postman environment: postman_environment.json

Postman collection with Schema tests: book_api_postman_collection_with_schema.json

Newman run script: run_newman.sh

package.json with Newman script: package.json

```

### Test_cases.cover:

```

Please provide test coverage report as per the original test plan with identified sections covered and those which are not covered manually example: Covered- Positive and negative create scenarios, Update operations with validation, Delete operations ...etc (Please expand this list) Not covered- TC4, TC20, TC24-29: Database shutdown scenarios, TC30-32: System-level failures, TC33-36: Environment configuration issues ...etc (Please expand this list)

```
